# Project: Datawarehouse with AWS Redshift

### Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

We are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Amazon Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to

###  Data
The datasets used for this project reside in S3 at the following locations:
* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data JSON path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`


The song data is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID

The log data consists of log files in JSON format generated by an [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, we create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables:

**Fact Table**
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
*songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

**Dimension Tables**
users - users in the app
*user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

songs - songs in music database
*song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

artists - artists in music database
*artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
*start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

### File Descritions
1. `cluster_helpers.py` contains utility functions for initializing and deleting the Redshift cluster based on the information supplied in `dwh.cfg`
2. `create_table.py` contains the logic to create the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift
3. `etl.py` contains the logic to load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and subsequently process them into fact and dimension tables in Redshift
4. `sql_queries.py` contains SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above that aid in the creation, deletion, and insertion of data into the staging and fact and dimension tables

### ETL Pipeline
1. The starting point of the pipeline is `create_tables.py`, which will first call the `initialize()` function defined in `cluster_helper.py` to create and initialize the Redshift cluster based on the configuration defined in `dwh.cfg`. This also dynamically updates the `dwh.cfg` file to include the created Redshift cluster's host name and the cluster's IAM role ARN for later steps in the pipeline to use
2. The staging, fact and dimension tables are then created based on the schema we've defined in `sql_queries.py` after authenticating to the cluster. We defined the schemas to use a diststyle of all, but future iterations should explore a more robust approach based on the keys. This works well for small datasets
3. The staging data from S3 is then loaded into the `staging_songs` and `staging_events` tables. We paid special attention to make sure to use the S3 `JSON_LOGPATH` provided and required the time format to be loaded into the `staging_events` table correctly as the raw data is an integer representing unix milliseconds, and we would like this to be in the timestamp format for ease of use in the next step of the pipeline
4. The data is then loaded into the dimension and fact tables. Since Redshift doesn't have any kind of upsert capability, we made sure to only select distinct non-null elements for each of the primary keys of the tables we've defined. We also paid special attention to only selecting elements from the `staging_events` table that have the `page='NextSong'` when inserting into the fact table `songplays`. In this step we also needed to join to the `staging_songs` data table to grab the  `song_id` and `artist_id` fields that are required in fact table. The join was made on the song title and artist name attributes


### Usage
To run the entire ETL pipeline first run:
`python create_tables.py`
followed by 
`python etl.py` to populate the fact and dimension tables in the star schema we've defined
We can then confirm that the tables are populated correctly in each of the fact and dimension tables under the schema defined in `sql_queries.py` by going to the AWS Redshift console under the query editor
**IMPORTANT**
Run `python cluster_helpers.py` so that the `clean_up()` function we've defined properly deletes the Redshift cluster and any of the other created resources so that we will not get charged
